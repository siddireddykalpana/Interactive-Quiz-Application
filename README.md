COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS
NAME: SIDDIREDDY KALPANA
INTERN ID:CT04DL129
DOMAIN:FRONT END DEVELOPMENT
DURATION:4 WEEKS
MENTOR: NEELA SANTHOSH
DESCRIPTION:This project is a web-based Interactive Quiz Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main objective was to create a clean, user-friendly app that allows users to answer multiple-choice questions and receive instant feedback after each response. Additionally, the app tracks the user's score in real time and displays a final result page upon completion of the quiz.

The design focuses on simplicity and accessibility, ensuring that users can navigate the quiz intuitively, whether on desktop or mobile. Questions are displayed one at a time to avoid clutter and help users stay focused.

⚙ Tools and Technologies Used
HTML5: Used to structure the quiz layout and elements, including the question container, answer buttons, feedback messages, and result summary.

CSS3: Responsible for all visual styling. A clean, responsive UI was created to make the app visually appealing on various screen sizes. Flexbox and media queries were used for layout control and responsiveness.

JavaScript (Vanilla): This handles the interactive logic of the quiz — including question loading, option selection, answer validation, instant feedback (correct/incorrect), score calculation, and navigation to the next question.

Visual Studio Code (VS Code): The editor platform used during development. It provided essential tools like IntelliSense, integrated terminal, Git control, and live server extensions, which made testing and debugging efficient.

Git & GitHub: Used for version control and remote hosting of the project files. The source code was pushed to a GitHub repository, and the application was deployed using GitHub Pages for live access.

✅ Key Features Implemented
Displays exactly 10 questions, shown one at a time with four multiple-choice options each.

Provides instant feedback after a user selects an answer (e.g., “Correct!” or “Incorrect.”), enhancing the learning experience.

Tracks and updates the score dynamically as each question is answered.

Presents a final results screen that summarizes the total score and allows the user to restart the quiz.

Fully responsive design optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

Clean, polished UI with color indicators for correct/incorrect answers and progress feedback.

🌐 Deployment and Hosting
The app was deployed on GitHub Pages, a free service that hosts static web projects. After pushing the final code to a GitHub repository, GitHub Pages was enabled through the repository settings, allowing the quiz to be accessed through a public URL. This makes it easy to share and use the application from any device with a web browser.

🎯 Where This Project is Applicable
This interactive quiz app has a wide range of practical applications, including:

E-learning platforms for testing students’ knowledge.

Schools and colleges for assignment-based mini-projects or semester submissions.

Job skill testing or interview screening.

Corporate training assessments.

Online surveys and trivia games with minimal adjustments.

Its lightweight, front-end-only design makes it extremely easy to deploy, share, and expand.

📁 File Structure
The project includes three essential files:

index.html – Contains the main structure and layout.

style.css – Contains all styling and responsiveness rules.

script.js – Handles quiz functionality, logic, and feedback.

These files were uploaded to GitHub via both drag-and-drop (using Add file > Upload files) and using the Git command-line interface (via git init, git add ., git commit, and git push).

📌 Conclusion
This task demonstrates essential skills in front-end web development, including responsive design, DOM manipulation, real-time feedback, and version control using Git. The project is not only technically sound but also polished and adaptable for real-world use. It reflects a solid understanding of how to build interactive applications with clean code and modern tools.
